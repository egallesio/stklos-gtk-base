This package is a simple wrapping of the GTK+ library.  Programming
with this package is very similar to programming a GUI in C. As a
consequence, standard GTK+ documentation can easily be followed to
build a GUI.

The documentation given here is automatically generated and details on
the package exported functions can be found in the standard 
http://gtk.org/documentation.html/[GTK+ documentation]

A simple GUI using this package is also available in
the http://www.stklos.net/Wiki/GUI/GTkBase/[STklos Wiki]
