			STKLOS-GTK-BASE


This is a simple binding of GTK+ (version 2) functions for STklos. This
binding extensively uses the STklos FFI and is completely written in
Scheme. The binding is quite direct and programming interfaces with it
is low level and very similar to programming a GTK+ GUI in C. An
example of a simple GUI is given in the example directory.
